   - A list of cars of a given model that have been in use for more than `n` years.
   - A list of cars of a given year of manufacture, the price of which is higher than the specified one.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure
- **Hometask2.java**: Main Java file containing the implementation.
- **cars_by_make.txt**: Text file containing the list of cars filtered by make.
- **cars_by_model_and_years.txt**: Text file containing the list of cars filtered by model and usage years.
- **cars_by_year_and_price.txt**: Text file containing the list of cars filtered by year and price.
